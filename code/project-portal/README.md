# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your local machine:

- **Node.js** (v12.0.0 or higher)
- **npm** (Node Package Manager, usually comes with Node.js)

You can verify the installation by running the following commands:

```sh
node -v
npm -v
```

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the project:

1. Clone the Repository
First clone the repository on your local machine. Then change directory in to your local project folder.

```git clone git@github.com:BUMETCS673/project-thisisteam4.git
cd project-thisisteam4
```

2.Install Dependancies
Navigate to the project directory under ```/code``` and install the necessary dependencies:

```
npm install
```

3.Start the Development Server
To start teh development server:

```
npm run dev 
```

Vite will start the development server, and you should see output indicating that the server is running. By default, the application will be accessible at `http://localhost:5173`. You can open this URL in your web browser to view the application.

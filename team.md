### Brenna Mahn

Hi team, I'm Brenna. I'm based in New Orleans, LA. I have been working as an app developer for the past few years after a career switch from finance. I've taken several courses towards my Master's in Software Development here at BU including a Software Quality and Testing course where I worked with another team to create a job searching webapp and a Android development course where I built a pet budgeting app. My main strengths are in cross platform and native app development but I've also worked with Python, Java, Javascript, CSS, and HTML.

### Savien Brooke Love

Hi team!

My name is Savien, but I go by Brooke. I am based in a small town in Georgia called Valdosta. I have been a Full-Stack Developer for about three years now. I am in my last course to get my Master's in Software Development. I am really excited to start on this project. My tech stack includes React, Javascript, Java, CSS, SCSS, MySQL, NoSQL and more! I am really excited to see how it goes. When I am not being a new wife or a pet mom my passions outside of coding are tattooing, cooking, volleyball, adventuring, and photography! Excited to work with all of you.

XOXO,
Brooke
